# VCF Operations vCommunity Content 

This management pack lowers the knowledge barrier required to add your own content to Aria Operations. While the MP Builder is better for quick and simple addition, a native management pack empowers you to build more powerful features. 
With some programming and API knowledge, you can do the following:
* Add your own object
* Add your own metrics and properties. They can have complex logic as it's all done in programming. Attach them into existing object.
* Add your own alerts, dashboards, reports. To override existing ones, simply use the same ID
* Add your own super metric. This is handy if you want your users to be able to customise the formula, as super metric is editable.
* Add your own widget. Example is https://www.vcrocs.info/chartjs/

## System Requirements
```
* vSphere API version must be higher than 8.0.1.0 (vSphere 7.x versions are not supported)
* Aria Operations Manager 8.18. Advanced or Enterprise edition.
```

## Management Pack Service Account User Permission Requirements
```
* An account with read-only permission
* Propagate to children option must be selected
```
